Describtion:

Project: J-K Cabinetry App / UI Prototype

A Figma prototype for a cabinetry / kitchen & bathroom design app inspired by / for J-K Cabinetry. This project focuses on helping users explore cabinetry options, visualize designs, and access product & specification data in an intuitive, attractive interface.

Key Features / Components

Catalog / Product Lines
Exploration of different cabinet styles (“cabinet lines”), finishes, color options, and SKU variations. Users can browse the range of design options available.

Design Inspiration & Gallery
Visual galleries or inspiration boards showing kitchens / bathrooms with various cabinet styles, helping users see how different finishes and designs look in real settings.

Product Detail Views
When a user taps on a cabinet style: full detail including images, finish/color options, dimensions/specs, features, possibly variants (door type, hardware, etc.).

Visualizer / Design Preview Tool
Likely screens that allow users to preview how cabinetry looks in a space (kitchen or bathroom layout), choose different finishes or styles, toggle between styles for comparison.

Filtering / Search
Functionality to filter catalog by style (traditional / contemporary / transitional), finishes (glossy, matte, glazed, etc.), color, perhaps price or availability.

Profile / Preferences
User preferences: saved favorites, previous visualizations, possibly showroom or dealer locators.

Resources / Support
Access to spec sheets, catalogs, assembly instructions, FAQs, care guides, etc.

Navigation & UI Structure
Organized navigation between browsing, visualizing, viewing details, and resources. Clean layout to handle many styles and visual-heavy content.

Visual & UX Style

Emphasis on visuals: high-quality images of cabinetry, realistic finishes, clean and polished mockups.

Typography and layout tailored for reading specs and product details: well organized, legible.

Use of color and materials to help users compare options easily (color swatches, finish previews).

Smooth transitions between viewing options, toggling between finishes, seeing before/after or side-by-side views.

Goals & Purpose

To provide an app UI that helps potential customers or designers explore cabinetry options in a more immersive and visual way.

To reduce decision friction: enabling comparisons, giving clear specifications, inspiring design ideas.

To showcase design skills in a product-heavy app: managing large catalog, visual previews, filters, and resource integration (specs, support content).
